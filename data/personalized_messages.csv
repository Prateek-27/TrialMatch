Rina1999,"I've been looking into clinical trials and research studies and I'm interested in participating in some of them, however I don't know if I am allowed to do so without health insurance.

So my question is can I partake in studies and trials without being insured?

Thank you!",positive,"Hi Rina1999!

I'm glad to hear that you're interested in participating in clinical trials and research studies. While some trials may require health insurance, many others don't. It really depends on the specific trial and the sponsor. I'd be happy to help you explore your options.

deliberatedice,"Hi everyone,

I'm currently running a behavioral study regarding patience and mental health, needing 128 participants. Before I send our study for IRB Review, I can't see how 128 people would be willing to spend 60 minutes on a study with no incentive. This is a virtual study so incentives would ideally be virtual as well. 

  
The targeted population are students around a college campus. I was considering posting this study for volunteer or mental health organizations but that may skew a population bias. 

  
I was wondering if anyone had experience with finding incentives, such as fast food gift cards or anything that would incentive a participant donating their time. 

Thanks so much and I look forward to hearing back from you all.

Thank you!
Comment: Health insurance is not a requirement per se, but please understand that clinical trials are not a substitute for clinical care. You are expected to be seeing a primary care doctor and any appropriate specialists for your medical needs outside of the research study. Additionally, trials also involve collecting standard of care data which would be billed to you or to your insurance company; research studies to not cover all of the costs associated with your care. If you are unable to afford the standard of care visits, you would be unable to participate in the trial. So it depends on what the study involves. I advise reading through the consent form carefully paying attention to the required procedures and what is and what is not covered by the study sponsor, and ask the research coordinator your questions to determine if you qualify.",positive,"Hi Ok-Equivalent9165, thanks for your interest in clinical trials! I see you have concerns about participating without health insurance. I'd like to clarify that while insurance isn't a requirement, you'll need to ensure you can afford standard care outside of the trial.

Comment: Motivation to be in a trial can be several things. 1. You want that drug. 2. You are seeking treatment, and the current options are expensive or don't work. 3.

Comment: Journal abstract:

>Trail running is a fast-growing sport, linked to improvements in both physical and psychological well-being. Despite its popularity, the preferences of trail runners are not well known. The objective of this study was to examine the environmental preferences and concerns of trail runners with respect to age and gender. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of recreational trail runners. A total of 548 people responded, of which 50.1% of respondents were women and 44.2% were men. The sample was distributed relatively evenly across age groups, up to 54 years; respondents over 55 represented only 9.4% of the sample. Comparisons of runner characteristics by gender indicated significant differences (p < 0.05) according to age, distance run per week, and number of days run per week. Certain runner preferences also differed significantly by gender, including importance of running around others, the type of trail races they seek, and whether or not they like to seek “vert” or elevation in their runs. Major concerns for both genders while running included lack of cell reception (Men: 33.8%; Women: 50.8%) and getting lost (Men: 26.8%; Women: 35.5%). Comparisons of the results of this study help to strengthen our understanding of trail runners’ environmental preferences and concerns and can be used to guide future design and maintenance of trail environments to encourage greater participation in the sport.",positive,"""Hi Hrmbee, I noticed your interest in clinical trials and your thoughtful comment on our recent post about trail running preferences.
