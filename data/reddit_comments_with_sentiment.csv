1esyav3,lifuqxv,"Health insurance is not a requirement per se, but please understand that clinical trials are not a substitute for clinical care. You are expected to be seeing a primary care doctor and any appropriate specialists for your medical needs outside of the research study. Additionally, trials also involve collecting standard of care data which would be billed to you or to your insurance company; research studies to not cover all of the costs associated with your care. If you are unable to afford the standard of care visits, you would be unable to participate in the trial. So it depends on what the study involves. I advise reading through the consent form carefully paying attention to the required procedures and what is and what is not covered by the study sponsor, and ask the research coordinator your questions to determine if you qualify.",1,1723830371.0,Ok-Equivalent9165,0.9827,positive

1ekst3y,lh6nxn0,A company called Tremendous is one that we've seen used often for virtual incentives if that's helpful. There's also a few incentive calculators out there if that's been a challenge as well.,1,1723156255.0,UI_community,0.8402,positive

It doesn’t always mean you are eligible for trials though - a lot of clinical trials have very specific inclusion and exclusion criteria.",2,1721412133.0,avianpower,0.128,positive
1e7536t,le5hhja,"Motivation to be in a trial can be several things. 1. You want that drug. 2. You are seeking treatment, and the current options are expensive or don't work. 3. You need the medication anyway and want to get paid for it. I do this with flu shots, btw. 4. You are a healthy volunteer looking to get free medical care / payments for participation. 5. You want to do good for future generations. This is common in genetic diseases where people pass down genetics and want to try to help find cures for their future lineage.6. Your doc recommends it. 7. Any other reason in the world!
If you are looking for trials, search the web, search clinicaltrials.gov, and reach out to local independent research companies and all your doctors.",2,1721518155.0,ResearchNerdOnABeach,0.9523,positive

1dvyv1a,lbqupwq,"Journal abstract:

>Trail running is a fast-growing sport, linked to improvements in both physical and psychological well-being. Despite its popularity, the preferences of trail runners are not well known. The objective of this study was to examine the environmental preferences and concerns of trail runners with respect to age and gender. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of recreational trail runners. A total of 548 people responded, of which 50.1% of respondents were women and 44.2% were men. The sample was distributed relatively evenly across age groups, up to 54 years; respondents over 55 represented only 9.4% of the sample. Comparisons of runner characteristics by gender indicated significant differences (p < 0.05) according to age, distance run per week, and number of days run per week. Certain runner preferences also differed significantly by gender, including importance of running around others, the type of trail races they seek, and whether or not they like to seek “vert” or elevation in their runs. Major concerns for both genders while running included lack of cell reception (Men: 33.8%; Women: 50.8%) and getting lost (Men: 26.8%; Women: 35.5%). Comparisons of the results of this study help to strengthen our understanding of trail runners’ environmental preferences and concerns and can be used to guide future design and maintenance of trail environments to encourage greater participation in the sport.",2,1720188566.0,Hrmbee,0.8962,positive
