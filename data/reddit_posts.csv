1esyav3,Can I participate in research studies and clinical trials without health insurance in Canada?,"I've been looking into clinical trials and research studies and I'm interested in participating in some of them, however I don't know if I am allowed to do so without health insurance.

So my question is can I partake in studies and trials without being insured?

Thank you!",3,2,1723736152.0,clinicalresearch,Rina1999
1ekst3y,Question on Finding Incentives for Research Study,"Hi everyone,

I'm currently running a behavioral study regarding patience and mental health, needing 128 participants. Before I send our study for IRB Review, I can't see how 128 people would be willing to spend 60 minutes on a study with no incentive. This is a virtual study so incentives would ideally be virtual as well. 

  
The targeted population are students around a college campus. I was considering posting this study for volunteer or mental health organizations but that may skew a population bias. 

  
I was wondering if anyone had experience with finding incentives, such as fast food gift cards or anything that would incentive a participant donating their time. 

Thanks so much and I look forward to hearing back from you all. ",2,2,1722876759.0,clinicalresearch,deliberatedice
