Hi Ok_Diamond_9644,

It's impressive to see your interest in clinical trials! As someone who has conducted site selection and site initiation visits for oncology studies, I understand the level of expertise required to train site teams and principal investigators.

Considering your background, I think you could definitely be a strong candidate for CRA roles that require oncology experience. Your experience learning RECIST and training on oncology protocols suggests you have a solid foundation.

deliberatedice,"Hi everyone,

I'm currently running a behavioral study regarding patience and mental health, needing 128 participants. Before I send our study for IRB Review, I can't see how 128 people would be willing to spend 60 minutes on a study with no incentive. This is a virtual study so incentives would ideally be virtual as well. 

  
The targeted population are students around a college campus. I was considering posting this study for volunteer or mental health organizations but that may skew a population bias. 

  
I was wondering if anyone had experience with finding incentives, such as fast food gift cards or anything that would incentive a participant donating their time. 

Thanks so much and I look forward to hearing back from you all. ",positive,"Here is a personalized message to deliberatedice:

Thank you!
Comment: Health insurance is not a requirement per se, but please understand that clinical trials are not a substitute for clinical care. You are expected to be seeing a primary care doctor and any appropriate specialists for your medical needs outside of the research study. Additionally, trials also involve collecting standard of care data which would be billed to you or to your insurance company; research studies to not cover all of the costs associated with your care. If you are unable to afford the standard of care visits, you would be unable to participate in the trial. So it depends on what the study involves. I advise reading through the consent form carefully paying attention to the required procedures and what is and what is not covered by the study sponsor, and ask the research coordinator your questions to determine if you qualify.",positive,"""Hi Ok-Equivalent9165!

Comment: I don't see an issue with it, but they are going to ask you questions during an interview that will likely make it clear if you know oncology or not. It's very different from running other kinds of trials. Also if you add oncology experience to your resume it will pretty much pigeon hole you forever into Onco CRA roles. They are harder to monitor than most other disease trials and knowing how to do it well is a skill that sponsors and CROs desperately want.",positive,"Here is a personalized message:

Hi Chitownscience,

I wanted to follow up on your comment about applying for CRA roles that require oncology experience. I completely agree with your perspective that your experience conducting site selection and initiation visits for oncology studies can be valuable, but will ultimately come down to how well you can demonstrate your knowledge in an interview. I would encourage you to highlight your transferable skills and the specific training you received during those visits.

Comment: You definitely still go on site a lot. Most clinics and hospitals have stopped restricting on-site travel. There is an industry shift to allow more off site visits, but off site presents a whole host of issues. For one, it's much harder to establish a good working rapport with the site staff so they likey will not be as responsive since they don't have to deal with you directly. Remote sites tend to have way more data issues, protocol deviations, unresolved action items, etc. Your workload will remain high so don't be fooled. Many sponsors and CROs are pushing for a return to on-site visits like we did pre-covid because of all of the issues that fully remote has caused for trials. That face time with your site staff makes things run much more smoothly and being on-site allows you to resolve or identify issues much much more easily.",positive,"Here is a personalized message to Chitownscience:

Fine_Design9777,"Post: I see posts on LinkedIn for Study Manager or Trial Manager at ICON. What is the difference?
Comment: CTM is usually the equivalent of a Lead CRA if it's at a CRO but can be more of a PM position if it's at a small sponsor.
Study Manager can vary even within the same CRO because it might be for an FSP position, in which case it's based in the sponsors job title/role & not the CRO'S.

Basically, make your decision to apply based on the job description because that explains what you'll be doing. Title/role may be fluid from company to company.

Job descriptions that focus mostly on site management, CRA management & reviewing monitoring reports are usually more of a CTM/CRA Lead position.
If it focuses on budget, timeline & study team management then it’s probably more of a PM position.
If it describes both then run b/c they are going to work you to death.",negative,"Here is a personalized message for Fine_Design9777:
